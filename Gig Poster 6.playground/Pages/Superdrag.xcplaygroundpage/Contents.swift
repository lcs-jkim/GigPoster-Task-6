/*:
 Each image is exactly 400 pixels wide by 600 pixels tall.
 
 Your goal is to precisely reproduce this image:
 
 ![superdrag-no-grid](superdrag-no-grid.png "Talking Heads")
 ![superdrag-with-grid](superdrag-with-grid.png "Talking Heads")
 
 By precisely reproducing this image, you will demonstrate your understanding of:
 
 * sequence (order of statements in a program)
 * conditionals (making decisions with ``if`` statements)
 * iteration (use of loops to repeat statements)
 * use of arithmetic operators in expressions
 * functions
 
 You may use the color constants created below to obtain the correct colors.
 
 Remember that you can refer to the [Canvas class documentation](https://www.russellgordon.ca/canvasgraphics/documentation/classes/canvas), as needed.
 
 ## Use Source Control
 
 To create evidence that supports your case for exceeding expectations for thread 3:

 * You *must* commit and push regularly ... *not* just at the end of this task.

 * You *must* complete your work prior to 1:00 PM on Friday, March 6, 2020.
 
 Good luck! You've got this! üëäüèªüëäüèºüëäüèΩüëäüèæüëäüèø
